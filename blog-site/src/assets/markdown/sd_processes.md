There are many factors that determine how and why you use the process that you do to develop software the goal of this post is to go over the many forms of software development and the advantages and downfalls of each form. This will be an active document through the month as I go through each form of development.

### Waterfall

#### Methodology

The waterfall development approach or the linear/traditional approach to Software Development works via a regimented sequence of events such as the following:

1.  Gather and document requirements
2.  Design
3.  Code and Unit Testing or Implementation
4.  System Testing
5.  Perform User Acceptance Testing or Verification
6.  Fix Issues
7.  Deliver the Finished Product or Maintenance and Operations

A true waterfall process is a process where each phase in the process is distinct and one phase must end for the other to begin.There are several advantages to using this regimented and well-defined approach in the software development process and a subset of projects that this approach would work best with.

#### Advantages

*   There is a clear definition and understanding of the requirements needed going forward between the customer and the development team
*   Progress can be easily measured as the scope of work needed to complete the project is known in advance
*   A project manager can plan the project so that every member can be involved and simultaneously work on other projects when they need to
*   A project manager can plan the project so that every member can be involved and simultaneously work on other projects when they need to and come back to this project when they are needed
*   Because the deliverables are well designed the software can be designed completely without adding features at the end that may waver from the original ideas. (AKA Feature Creep)

#### Disadvantages

*   The need for specific details for requirements can be intimidating and in some cases impossible to do so before development starts. Many of these can be hashed out in the requirements/design process but in such cases you’re no longer doing a pure Waterfall approach
*   Customer may be dissatisfied with the product because in many cases the customer will not see the product until it is almost finished. Changes at this point can be incredibly costly as you’ll have to go back over requirements, design and implementation again.

#### **Best when used with:**

Smaller projects where requirements can be easily defined

### Agile

#### Methodology

Agile is an iterative approach where the emphasis is on both the customer and the team. This approach to software development emphasizes rapid delivery of applications with complete and functional components. Projects are completed in “sprints”, where certain deliverables are prioritized by the customer and each sprint has a defined duration.

After each sprint the customer and team/project leads can review the work and evaluate the process. These customer reviews are essential to giving the customer the exact product they’d like.

Like the waterfall approach there are some well-defined advantages and disadvatages to this approach. That being said, many of the companies I've worked with have implemented some features of Agile as their main development approach.

#### Advantages

*   The customer is involved in the process and as such they can make changes to the product so the final product is exactly to their specs.
*   Using the agile approach the time to market can be a lot quicker as a bare-bones product can be released early then be built upon in successive iterations.
*   The customer has an opportunity to see the work being delivered and can make decisions and changes throughout the process to make sure the product delivered fits their needs
*   Development is normally user focused due to the involvement of the customer
*   The Agile development process allows for change and teams can constantly refine the product based on the customers needs.
*   By breaking the product down into smaller, well-defined units it can be easily tested and the final product will be higher-quality with fewer bugs. It will also be easier to integrate new features into the product.

#### Disadvantages

*   If the customer is not an active participant due to time or interest then this process will be difficult because of the need for customer involvment at each stage of development.
*   This process is easiest when the team works in the same physical space due to the importance of a collabrative team environment
*   Some items may not be completed in the time period alloted for it. As such additional sprints may be needed to complete the project, adding to the overall cost.
*   While change is welcome, due to prioritizing change may come at the expense of time, money and other features.
*   By not having a well defined design at the start there may be feature creep, where the product doesn’t fulfill the deliverables for which it was originally conceived.
*   This process works best when team members are completely dedicated to the product.

#### **Best when used with:**

Larger projects with lots of smaller features that can be developed iteratively

### Scrum

#### Methodology

Scrum is an Agile framework specifically for complex projects. Like other Agile processes it emphasizes team collaboration and a set of rules to create structure. It is an iterative and incremental approach to control risk. It is a transparent, controlled process that is highly adaptable based. In scrum you have four scrum events:

*   Sprint Planning

*   What can be done this Sprint?
*   How will it get done?
*   How does this apply to the project?

*   Daily Scrum

*   A quick meeting for the development team held every day of the sprint. During which the next 24 hours of the sprint are planned. The goal is to optimize team collaboration and performance while eliminating other impediments like extra meetings and promoting quick decision making.

*   Sprint Review

*   A meeting at thend of the sprint to go over what was accomplished, increment the product backlog and a collaboration on the next steps needed to optimize value.

*   Sprint Retrospective

*   A meeting to look at a sprint and create a plan to improve for the next one. Specifically looking at people, relationships, process and tools and improving the way the Scrum team functions.

The scrum team consists of three members/groups and incrementally delivers finished products so that a potentially working product is always available. The members of the team consist of the:

*   Product Owner

*   One person who manages the product backlog and ensures that it is transparent, and visible to all. Also this person will optimize the work of the Development team and show what the team will work on next.

*   The Development Team

*   A team small enough to remain nimble but large enough to perform the work needed in the pre-defined sprint period. Accountability for the team is taken on by the team as a while and all domains including testing, operations, and architecture is managed by the team. These are the members who deliver the finished increment at the end of each sprint

*   The Scrum Master

*   The role of the Scrum master is be a servant to the team and making sure the team understands the rules, theory and practices of Scrum. Basically the Scrum master acts as the ambassador to Scrum development and keeps the team informed of any deviations from Scrum.

#### Advantages

*   Fast moving and flexible
*   Mistakes can be easily rectified due to smaller goals
*   Extremely transparent process with constant feedback
*   Iterative in nature and requires constant user feedback
*   Overhead cost due to managment is minimal as there are predefined time and fixed oversight

#### Disadvantages

*   Potential for feature and scope creep
*   Hard to estimate overall project costs if product is not well-defined
*   Only works well with a small, experienced team. With inexperienced novices the projects will not be completed
*   Team members must be devoted to the project and cannot leave during development

#### **Best when used with:**

Fast moving web 2.0 projects
