    <!--Who Am I-->
    <h5>As you can see I've worn a lot of hats throughout my personal and professional life
    This is because of my passion for personal growth and the understanding that growth only comes from challenging oneself. I've been a life-long learner with over 12 years of post high school education, earning 3 Bachelor Degrees and an MBA with a concentration on Information Manangement Systems. As such a lot of things can define who I am, too much to fit on any sort of resume. My journey has been a long one but each step has led me to the next.</h5>

    <h5>However the purpose of this page is not to tell you who I am or where I came from, rather, it's to show you where I'm going next.</h5>

    <h4><em>In Tech...</em></h4>
    <p>After Graduating from Oregon State University the importance of continuing education has never been more apparent, especially in this field. While the University program outlined the most important aspects of Computer Science, the field changes so quickly that it can be hard to keep up if you let your guard down for a second. From my first exposure to programming in Grad School back in 2011 to today so much has changed. As such I've taken it upon myself to work on personal projects and certifications to better understand the ever-changing technological landscape </p>
    <p>I've developed a special fascination with distributed computing models and the science behind them. Because of this fascination I've been focused on understanding the tools available to developers through AWS. As such, I've been working to complete a few of their certifications as well as others from agencies that interest me. <br> Just recently I completed the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Certification: </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Now I'm working towards earning the following certifications to better my personal understanding of the tools available to developers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS Certified Developer - Associate</li>
        <li>CompTIA Security+</li>
      </ul>
